## Equilibria:
Trivial equilibrium $\hat{N}=0$
Two quadratic solutions: $\hat{N} = -1/\beta T$ and $\hat{N} = K$
Then, there are more equilibria along the line $f(x) = \beta P$, since this is where the quadratic must be equal to this to solve to zero
- Stable equilibrium at the intersection of this line and the parabola when
### Special equilibrium
If there was a very precise number of predators such that  $\beta P$ is equal to the exact maximum of our parabola, this equilibrium would be both stable and unstable, and also the only equilibrium other than the trivial one. We call this point $P_F$ the fold bifurcation point

## Bifurcation Diagram
This can be used to show the stability of the equilibria:.

We plot N as a function of P:
