Pick one of the four scenarios given below:

• Egg size increases with female size.
	- This means that 2SW salmon will produce offpsring that have higher fitness
	- This means lower FW1 - SW1 mortality, and thus higher SW1 proportion

• Habitat availability and competition during spawning.
	- Competition might result in 2SW females outcompeting 1SW individuals since they are larger (increasing SW1 mortality)
	- Or maybe this could result inmore SW1 if they can access more small streams that have less competiton (expand intonew habitats)

• Genetic correlation between age-at maturity & behavior.
	- 
• Iteroparity exists in the population and is genetically correlated to early maturation.
- Early maturing individuals will be able to reproduce again, so we would expect
