Questions asked in evolutionary biology:
- Rates of speciation and extinction
- Microevolution vs Macroevolution

## Mechanisms of Evolution
- Natural Selection
- Sexual selection
- Genetic Drift / mutation
- Gene flow - populations differ in allelic frequency
	- Flow between one population (location) to another
- **Gene locus**
**Changes in allele frequency causes evolution**

## Natural Selection
- Individuals with different phenotypes have different fitness - fitness variation is correlated with phenotypic variation
- Phenotypes co-vary between related individuals

# Avoid adaptive storytelling in evolutionary biology
- Not every trait is the result of adaptation
- We must distinguish between *proximate* and *ultimate* factors (how vs why)
- Example: Why is marsh warbler song more complicated than grasshopper warbler?
	- Proximate cause: Song nucleus in m.w. brain is larger
	- Ultimate cause: Female m.w. prefer males with more complex songs
- Adaptionist view: 
	- Diversity is always the result of adaptation
- Pluralist approach:
	- [[Evolutionary Biology/Trade-off\|Trade-off]]s among competing selective demands cause non-optamality
	- Build testable hypotheses
	- Evolution of an organism is constrained by ancestry, allometry, developmental pathways, mechanistic (*[Baupläne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_plan)*) and genetic architectures
