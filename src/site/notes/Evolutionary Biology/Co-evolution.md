# Types of co-evolution ([[Ecology/Species Interactions\|Species Interactions]])
- Predator-prey ([[Ecology/Exploitation\|Exploitation]])
- Parasite - host ([[Ecology/Exploitation\|Exploitation]])
- [[Ecology/Facilitation\|Mutualism]]
	- Facultative or obligate
	- In the shrimp example, it's facultative for the fish and obligate for the shrimp
- [[Ecology/Competition\|Competitors]]
	- Competing for the same resources
	- Example - threespine stickleback species pairs who differentiate to avoid competition
	- 
# Examples
## Well-being
- Bedbug / *Wolbachia* co-evolution
	- These *Wolbachia* bacteria provide vitamins to the bedbugs
	- By studying these, they developed new treatments for bedbugs
## [[Ecology/Applied Ecology\|Conservation]]
- ==Speciation in coral reef studying?==
## Fig-wasp mutualism
- *Ficus* figs are actually inflorescences 
- Complicated life cycle with wasps - obligate mutualism
	- Female wasps enter the fig to pollinate the female flowers and lays eggs
	- Later, the eggs hatch and the young leave, covered in pollen, to lay eggs in another cell
- Males are only suited for boring holes so the females can leave the figs, often have no wings
- Females are adapted to flying, burrowing into figs and laying eggs in the fig oocyte
- Parasitic element also - there are some paracitic wasps who use a long ovipositor to puncture the egg and lay from the outside without pollinating the fig
	- This parasite reduces fitness in both figs and pollinator wasp
		- Some species will predate on the pollinator wasps
- Figs balance their own reproductive success to try and avoid the parasites and encourage the pollinator wasps
	- Co-evolution: They may produce flowers at different style lengths... ==why??==
	- Some will produce either all-male or all-female flowers... this somehow reduces parasitism?

# Arms Race
- [[Red Queen Hypothesis\|Red Queen Hypothesis]]
	- Must constantly adapt just in order to survive (stay in place)
- [[Sexual Selection\|Sexual Conflict]]
## Arms Race Example - *Passiflora* and *Heliconius*
- *Passiflora* flowers defend using certain chemical defenses against certain insects
- *Heliconius* butterflies eat these compounds, which they tolerate, but also use these to become toxic to predators
### Structural changes
- *Passiflora* evolved very diverse leaf shapes and sizes
	- This makes it harder for butterflies to recognize the *Passiflora* as a host plant, since they rely on visual clues to decide where to lay their eggs
- Developed little structures that mimic eggs, to make the butterflies think the plant has already had eggs laid on it
#### Response
- *Heliconius* have evolved larger brains in order to distinguish shape and chemical profiles of plants
### Ant protection
- Developed little non-floral glands that produce substances to attract ants, which will also defend against *Heliconius* or other predatory insects
#### Response
- Laying eggs on specific parts of the plants where the ants can't reach
### Trichomes
- Tricohmes on some species - tiny hooks on the leaves that are defenses against larva by preventing them from walking on the leaf
#### Response
- When they were first studied (1970s), it seemed that the plant had won here, no insects can avoid this
- However, it was found that one *Heliconius* species *charithonia* could survive by eating the tips of the trichomes (2008)

# Co-evolution at a local scale - evidence

> [!Coevolution at local scale]
> Maculinea alcon butterflies infect the nests of Myrmica ants by hatching caterpillars nearby, hoping that the caterpillars will be adopted and cared for by ants that mistake them for their own young. The caterpillars achieve this by mimicking the surface chemistry of the ants. The overlap in distribution of the host ants and parasitic caterpillars is small. We can hypothesise that to avoid parasitism, ants should favour heritable genetic changes in surface chemistry, making the ant larvae distinguishable from the butterfly larvae.

- Some species use mimicry with their hosts such as this kind of butterfy which have larva that mimic *Myrmica* ant chemical signals so that they are raised by the ants
- They have very small amounts of overlap  (at Åland)
	- Two species - *rubra* and *ruginoidis*
		- rubra ants have more diversity in chemical profiles between colonies, so the butterflies fail to infect (trick) it with their fake larva
		- ruginoides are more susceptible since their chemical profiles vary less
# Geographical Mosaic Theory of Co-evolution
- Co-evolution is a spatially-structured process
## Assumptions:
- Species are collections of distinct populations
- Interacting species differ in geogrpahic ranges
- Interactions differ between environments
## Three sources of variations
- Geographic selection (e.g. differences in climate, temp, elevation)
	- Adaptation that is good in one env is negative in others
- Evolutionary coldspots vs [[Evolutionary Hot Spot\|Evolutionary Hot Spot]]
	- **Hot Spot**: Geographic location with a high rate of evolutionary change, such as a tropical area with high biodiversity, such as 
- ==Trait remixing?==
# In fossil record: 
## Angiosperm and beetle co-evolution
- There is a correlation between beetle diversity following divergences in angiosperm diversity
- Exponential increase in angiosperms in cretaceous led to massive diversification of beetles
## Gastropod and predator co-evolution
- However, in the fossil record it is difficult to infer types of relationships
	- We can infer some predator-prey relations like fossil mussel shells that show evidence of predation and whether it was successful or not
	- WE can see a correlation between mobile gastropods vssessile throughout geological time
	- Also seeing thickened shells and narrow aperture species increase throughout time
# Law of constant extinction
- Probability of extinction is constant throughout the course of evolution
- A species could dissapear at any time
- All taxa must continue to evolve to avoid extinction - species that have been around longer are not necessarily better at avoiding extinction
- Every adaptation results in a [[Evolutionary Biology/Trade-off\|Trade-off]], and species constantly need to be adapting
- This supports the [[Red Queen Hypothesis\|Red Queen Hypothesis]]
# Biotic vs Abiotic interactions
- Co-evolution is exclusively with biotic interactions

# Host-parasite co-evolution in honeybees
[[Evolutionary Biology/Articles/Coevolution-in-realtime_varroa-honeybees_2021.pdf]]
- Mite-resistant bee populations will open sealed cells containing larvae, look for mites, and eat the infected larvae or re-seal
- Some bees have different development times, for example if they spend less time as a mite then there is less time for the mites to become infected
- Untreated bees - have not received mite treatment, so they have co-evolved with the mite
- Treatment
## Hypothesis
- Expecting reduced virulece in the parasite which should be influenced by the rates of reproduction in the mother mites (mite fecundity)
- They would expect that this would also result in higher *fertility*
- Create a full-crossed experiment:

| AWD bees in AWD-selected mites     | AWD Selected bees in treated mites |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Treated bees in AWD selected mites | Treated bees in treated mites      |
We would expect that both of the matching pairs would preform better than in the mismatched ones
## Results
Bees might have a mechanism to suppress mite reproduction, but these behaviours don't seem to be able to explain the result - the bees did not show enough recapping mechanisms
- Treated mites didn't find any shift in their ability to survive onselected bees
	- This indicates thatthere mightnot be a lot of movement between bee colonies
## Follow up questions
- ==Compare fitness cost of VSH behaviour in infected vs non infected colonies==
	- Do the VSH bees show this behaviour if they aren't infected with mites?
	- Do they have a statistical difference in reproductive output compared to non-VSH bees?
	- Don't infect any of them with mites
- Determine if the VSH bees success rate in identifying infected larva - do they make mistakes?
- Explore the effect of drone pupa interfereing with mite oogenesis
	- For example, we could remove all the drones before they pupate and see if there is an effect on mite oogenesis
- Environmental effects and VSH - reducing amount of nectar
	- Add another two colonies to the experiment with reduced nectar. Does the AWD colony preform better or worse than the treated colony when resources are limited?
- How many generations with no mites until the behaviour dissapears?
	- For example, test each generation and see if they start to show this behaviour, how long until they stop displaying this?
