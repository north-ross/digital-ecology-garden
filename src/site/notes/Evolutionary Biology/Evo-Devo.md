Evolutionary Developmental Biology
# Background
## Embryos are hard to distinguish
- Developmental processes are shared between species
- When and how do they diverge? Between sexes, species, parts of the body?
## Proximate and ultimate causes
- [[Ecology/Four-Question Framework\|Four-Question Framework]]
- Evo Devo generally focused on proximate causes (not ultimate)
# Evo Devo
Main idea - changes in form require changes in develpoment
- Explanatory position of embryonic development within evolutionary theory
- Integrated developmental processes intothe [[Evolutionary Biology/Modern Synthesis of Darwinism\|Modern Synthesis of Darwinism]]
## Example - webbed feet
- Many tetrapods have webbed feet as embryos
- In birds, the development of webbed feet is linked to expression changes in BMP-gremlin pathway (proximate cause)
## History
- Modern synthesis of Darwinism has only started being studied with regard to developmental biology since the 1980s and 90s
# Big questions of Evo Devo
- What changes in developmental mechanisms give rise to different phenotypes?
- How do genetic differences among species map to phenotypic differences?
- What is the roleof development in constraining or enhancing evolutionary change?
- How does developmental information help us identify homologous characters?
- Can understanding development help us understand the origin of novel characteristics?
# Van Baers law
Species are often more similaras embryos than adults 
# Haeckel's recapitulation theory
Enst Haeckel (author my arm tattoo) "Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny" > development is sort of like a history of an organism's evolutionary history
# Homology
- Structures derived from a common ancestral structure are homologous

# Isometric and allometric growth
- Isometry: All body parts grow around the same rate
- Allometry: Different parts grow at different rates
	- For example, baby humans have large heads which grow slowly in relation to the rest of the body
## Growth Curves
- Measuring growth of different body parts on different plots can show if body parts grow at the same rate 
- In the below example, we have the human brain showing allometric growth and heart showing isometric growth
- In the beetle, allometric growth of mandibles between species

# Heterochrony
- Evolutionary change in timing and rates of developmental events
## Example: Zebra species
BEtween the plains zebra and Grévy's zebra, the Grevy's zebra has more dense stripes in its adult form
- They both show isometric growth, but the timing is different, so that *grevyi* zebras start developing the same pattern of stripes when they are already larger, so the stripes are more dense.

## Paedomorphosis
- Adult form of a species looks more like a juvenile compared to ancestor
## Neoteny
- Reduced rate of development, resulting in paedomorphosis.
	- Axolotl is an example of this, retaining their gills in adulthood
# Heterotopy
- Evolutionary change of the spatial position of a feature within an organism
	- Example- adventitious roots, extra thumb in panda
- "genetically easy solution to a complex problem"
# Modularity
- A vertebra or a tooth are like a "module" that can be repeated within a body
- "serially homologous"
## Individualization
- Distinct identities within an modular piece are individualization
	- Teeth are an example
# Key observations in Developmental Biology
- All cells in an organism have the same genes (mitosis)
- Differences among cells, tissues and organs are from differences in gene expression
- Different cells have properties that affect morphogenesis
	- Growth, shape, adhesion to cells, mitosis in certain dimensions, cellmovement, programmed cell death
- Some aspects are regulated by chemical signals like horomones
# Morphogenes
- A molecule that triggers specific cellular reponses depending on its concentration
- Can create regular patterns
# [[Gene Regulation\|Gene Regulation]]

==(I don't understand this - study)==

# Drosophila
- A mutation in Drosophila made their haltere develop into a second set of wings, like their ancestral forms
	- This couldhave been passed onto offpsring
- This mutation was caused by a **hox** gene (Ultrabithorax (UBX))
	- Hox genes are sorted on the geonome in the same order (from head to tail) as their affected part of development in the embryo
	- Turns out this type of gene is in mammals too and works similarly, nearly all animals have these genes
# Toolkit genes
- Genes like this are sometimes called "genetic toolkit" genes, shared widely among animal and can contribute to evolutionary changes in diverse developmental roles
- this same UBX gene in water striders controls th length of the middle legs ([[Evolutionary Biology/Co-option\|Co-option]])
# [[Gene Regulation\|Gene Regulation]] and Evolution
- Differences in length and depth of premaxilla in Darwin finchesare determined by gene Bmp4 during development
	- High, early Bmp4 - high beak depth and width
	- Low Bmp4 - low beak depth/width
- A similar gene regulates beak length

# UBX evolution and leg loss:
- This gene suppresses development of legs on abdomen
- A certain sequence of a protein stops the legs from growing on the abdomen
