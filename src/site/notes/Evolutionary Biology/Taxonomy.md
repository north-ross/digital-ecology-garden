# Taxonomy vs systematics
- taxonomy is "what is that" - getting the name right
	- Important for conservation - if you lump a species it may lose protection ([[Ecology/Applied Ecology\|Applied Ecology]])

## How many new species are there?
- 5 million described
- [[Evolutionary Biology/Speciation#Species definition\|Species Definitions]] can be challenging
## Challenges of taxonomy
- "Taxonomic anarchy" - Garnett and Christidis wrote that taxonomy is not sufficiently regulated
- Thompson argued back 2018
- Different groups recognize different numbers of taxa
- International Botanical Congress each five years announces plant species should be named
- Animals are less regulated - the same genus and species names are allowed
- Cyanobacteria - formerly classified as plants, nomenclature was transferred to bacterial code - the old ones still use the plant rules but the new ones use bacteria rules (total chaos!) 
	- That's why nobody has ever found the ancestor of plants and cyanobacteria?
# Integrated Taxonomy
- More like a Venn diagram with dots for distinct species and how they overlap in a 3D space
# "Taxonomy Version 4"
- Taxonomy 1 is morphometric
- Integrated taxonomy meets AI
- Based on genetic barcode, niches, morphology - into machine learning model
- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534723002963
- With new genes, integrative taxonomic approach gives a lot of new information, but new theories are needed. One gene can evolve in a different way - gene trees may not interact, but these don't match to the species tree
- Given all of this data
	- DNA
	- morphology
	- Biogeography/ecology
	- Ploidy/reproduction
	- Physiology
	- Behaviour
- This will be embdedded into a matrix model and assigned a species, which will be confirmed by a taxonomist. This software is under development
- DiSSCo (Distributed system of scientific collections) - european initiative to store all mseum collections and standardized
	- By the 2030s
# The herbarium of the future
- Research, policy-making global meta-herbarium
- Species discovery based on digitization
