An adaptation to favour related individuals to an organism, even at the expense of their own offspring. Altrusim in bees, ants, wasps, termites are classic examples

Often a mechanism that results in [[Evolutionary Biology/Cooperation\|Cooperation]] behaviour

# Example: Co-operation in eusocial hymenoptera
- Due to the haplodiploid nature, in a hive with one queen and one father:
	- The males are produced through parthinogenesis and have 100% of the same genes as the female
	- The females are $r=0.75$ to the queen since their father only gives one set of genes
- More complex:
	- Depends on sex ratio within colony
	- Has also evolved in diploid termites
