The process by which species evolve and develop traits which increase their fitness
- Traits that enhance an organism's ability to survive and reproduce is an adaptation, which results from natural selection.
- Example - Bird of paradise tail and coloration are not related to natural selection (sexual selection instead), it's not really an adaptation? Depends on definition
- Adaptations to avoid inbreeding, which causes inbreeding depression (susceptibility to diseases, reduction in overall genetic diversity, genetic bottlenecks)
- [[Ecology/Functional Trait\|Functional Trait]]s are ways to group and measure adaptations
## Trait evolution beyond adaptation
- traits under selection evolve after producing greater *net fitness* afterbalacing costs and effects
	- In eusocial organisms, traits can evolve to affect the fitness of other organisms that are closely related (altruism)
## Three components of Darwin's theories
### 1. There is trait (phenotype) variation among individuals
- By measuring these traits we can study this variation
	- morphological, physiological, behavioral, [[Ecology/Life History Adaptations\|Life History Adaptations]], molecular
- Example given of timing of growth patterns in trees varying latitudinally (budburst, growth cessation, bud set in oak, birch, pine, spruce)
### 2. Trait variation results in fitness variation among individuals

#### A. Reciprocal transplants to test for local adaptation
- Local provenances of *Pinus sylvestris* were transplanted to different latitudes and the amount of growth wasmeasured over 13 years
- The trees grew better when they were grown in the area where the seeds were collected due to their adaptation to the summer-winter differential
#### B. Color polymorphism in peppered moths
- melanistic morph is more common in industrialized areas of England with soot
#### C. Dispersal ability in dandelion papus
- behavioral / life-history
- Selective agent is [[Ecology/Competition\|Competition]] avoidance, inbreeding avoidance and "bet hedging" or diversifying portfolio
- Varies in population size, extinction rate
- A similar experiment with dispersal of *C. elegans* showed that individuals with greater dispersal suffered less extirpation events

### 3. Trait variation is inherited from one generation to the next
- This is crucial for the theory of evolution - only traits which can be inherited will contribute to evolution and speciation
- Trait values have a genetic and environmental component
	- Only the genetic component is inherited
- The environmental component can be random (noise), predictable (plasticity) or shared (common environment i.e. maternal effects)
