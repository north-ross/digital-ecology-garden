- Reproductive Isolation Barriers (RIBs), or isolating mechanisms, create barriers to gene flow
## Types of RIBs
- Prezygotic reduce likelihood of hybrids
- Postzygotic reduce gene exhange even if hybrid zygotes are produced 
	- reduced hybrid survival
	- reduced hybrid fertility
### Pre-mating barriers
- Ecological Isolation:
	- Temporal isolation
	- Habitat isolation
	- Immigrants between divergent populations do not survive long enough to breed
- Potential mates meet, but do not mate:
	- [[Sexual Selection\|Sexual isolation]]
	- Pollinator isolation
## Pre-zygotic barriers
- Mating occurs, but no zygotes
	- Mechanical- reproductive structures don't fit
	- Femals is not stimulated by males of another species to produce eggs
	- Gametic isolation - fertilization fails
## Post-zygotic barriers
- Hybrids form but have reduced fitness
	- Extrinsic (hybrids have low environmental fitness)
	- Evological inviability (poorly adapted to both parental habitats)
	- Behavioural sterility (less successful at obtaining mates)
	- In some cases, F1 hybrids can show "hybrid vigor", but this typically doesn't last multiple generations
		- Copepod example. Also mules and cattails
- Hybrid inviability:
	- Reduced survival due to genetic incompatibility
- Hybrid sterility
### Haldane's Rule
Hybrid sterility is limited to heterogametic sex (e.g. XY males in mammals and most insects)

# Speed of reproductive isolation
- Prezygotic isolation usually evolves faster than postzygotic isolation
	- Example in flies: In laboratory conditions, it was examined which flies mated, then postzygotic measured by survival of hybrids
