# Ecological speciation
- Caused by divergent selection, evological factors
- Often through ==pleiotropy==?
# Speciation by [[Genetic Conflict\|Genetic Conflict]]
- Selfish mutations have been found that transmit more copies to the next generation
# Speciation by [[Sexual Selection\|Sexual Selection]]
- Rapidly speciating animals will sometimes differ more in their secondary sexual traits (male coloration, vocalization)
- Pulse rate in crickets
- Why is it usually easier to discern plant families by their flowers? SHouldnt these change faster?
# Reinforcement of [[Evolutionary Biology/Reproductive Isolation\|Reproductive Isolation]]
- Once two populations have already developed some isolation, hybrids will have lower survival or fertility
- Selection against low-fitness hybrids is called reinforcement.
# Speciation by polyploidy
- When a diploid species geonome is doubled, a tetraploid is the result, with 4 copies of every chromosone
- Example: hybridization among goatsbeard species generated new allopolyploid species within the last several centuries.
