# Assigned reading
*Evolution* Douglas Futuyma chapters 10-13

- These chapters are about products of evolution (what has come from natural selection)
- Now we have a better understanding of how behaviour evolves, but also how behavioural traits influence evolutionary processes
# How does behaviour evolve?

There are three pathways for evolution:
## [[Evolutionary Biology/Natural Selection\|Natural Selection]]
- Individuals which are most fit for their environment and able to reproduce survive
## [[Sexual Selection\|Sexual Selection]]
- An adaptation which increases reproductive success, often at the expense of survival
## [[Evolutionary Biology/Kin Selection\|Kin Selection]]
- An adaptation to favour related individuals to an organism, even at the expense of their own offspring. Altrusim in bees, ants, wasps, termites are classic examples
## Natural vs Sexual Selection
An evolutionary tug of war between exagerrated sexual characteristics and their [[Evolutionary Biology/Trade-off\|Trade-off]]s in survival related characteristics (resource allocation, how easy they are able to be predated on)
### Example with broad-horned flour beetles
- Males with longer horns have greater reproductive success, at the [[Evolutionary Biology/Trade-off\|trade-off]]of smaller adbomens
- This gene is inherited in both males and females ([[Ecology/Evolutionary Conflict\|Intralocus sexual conflict]]), resulting in females with smaller abdomens who can lay fewer eggs
- In experimental conditions with no predators, larger horns are favored (and fewer eggs)
- When predators are included in the experiment, smaller horns and more eggs are favored.
## Are behaviours heritable?
- Behaviour is *labile* meaning it changes in response to the environment
- Therefore, it is difficult to detect heritability
- Until recently there were few examples of behaviours proven to be heritable
- Now, meta-analyses have shown that behavioural trails are within the same range of heritability as other [[Ecology/Life History Adaptations\|life-history]] and physiological traits
- This indicates that, contrary to an assumption, behavioural traits are just as heritable as other traits
## How and why does behaviour evolve?
- The [[Ecology/Four-Question Framework\|Four-Question Framework]] from Niko Tinbergen gives us a way to categorize these.
### [[Evolutionary Biology/Trade-off\|Trade-off]]s and fitness outcomes
- The "[[Darwinian Demon\|Darwinian Demon]]" is a thought experiment about imagining the "perfect organism"
- We can determine what makes an organism closer to ideal by modeling evolutionary dynamics:
- By considering the $C$osts and $B$enefits of behavioural strategies, we can:  
	- predict when a behaviour should evolve ( $B > C$ ) 
	- determine the optimal behaviour (maximize $B – C$)  
	- find the [[Math Methods/Dynamical Systems/Evolutionary Stable Strategy\|Evolutionary Stable Strategy]] - ESS ( $B - C$ cannot be bettered by an alternative)
- These equations are modified by environment and other organisms (population)
# How does behaviour influence evolutionary processes?
## Cultural inheritance
- Genes and culture are both inheritance systems that generate phenotypic change
	- Example - a bird's song has a genetic component, but is also influenced by their parent's songs in the nest and general environment
- Culture is a form of non-genetic inheritance
- Social transmission is not just inheritance - it can also be transmitted between other unrelated individuals, or even from kin to their parent.
## Gene-culture co-evolution (example in Galapagos finches)
- Many other pieces of circumstantial evidence of this taking place in other contexts as well.
- Rosemary Grant has a [lecture](https://academy.allaboutbirds.org/live-event/evolution-of-darwins-finches-integrating-behavior-ecology-and-genetics/) about integrating behaviour, ecology and genetics.
- Galapagos finch females are influenced by songs that they hear in their youth and prefer mates with these kinds of songs
- Variation can result in some females picking unfamiliar songs, these sorts of events eventually result in them choosing a new mate, and this kind of song will be passed on to her chicks.
- The behaviour can inhibit or allow speciation to take place in this group of birds
## Parental Care
Does parental care not only change the phenotype, but alter the adaptive value of that phenotype?
- In one case, the parents bring more food to the nest, the offspring grow bigger and have more offsprings
- In another case, the adults are larger
### Example: Burying beetles
Model system in [[Ecology/Behavioural Ecology\|Behavioural Ecology]]
- These breed with small animal carcasses which they bury in the ground and lay their eggs in
- They also prepare the carcass by rolling it into a ball and smear it with an anti-microbial enzyme
- There is variation in:
	- Amount of carcass preparation
	- Amount of parental care (time before leaving the larvae)
- Experimental evolution tested whether variation alters selection in offspring traits
- One control group had parents removed after making inscision in flesh, another left parents, another left no parents
	- Offspring beetles in the no-care line were more likely to make a hole in the carcass for the larva to eat
	- Larva in no-care line had larger madibles in proportion to their body mass than full-care when they were small, but older individuals had similar length mandibles
