## Effect of migration on allele frequencies
- ==The main effect of gene flow between populations is to **homogenize allele frequencies** until they are equal==
- If we have two populations (i and j), with migration rate $m$ the change in allele frequency per generation is
$$\Delta p_i = m_{ij}(p_j-p_i)$$
- $\Delta p$ is larger (faster) with higher $m_{ij}$ and a bigger difference in allele frequency between i and j.
## Migration and Selection
- Both migration and selection change allele frequencies in a population
- Migration can favor spreading a beneficial mutation in space, but can slow the rate of a beneficial mutation within a population
- Migration and selection can have *opposite effects* when selection varies withing a population
## Example: Water Snakes in Lake Erie
- Banded and unbanded morphs - the mainland population is usually banded and larger
- Island population unbanded
- Bands provide camouflage on mainland, but strongly counter selected on some islands because of rocks
- There is migration between populations
- Islands further from the mainland are less banded
## Balance between migration and selection
- important to understand maintenance of local adaptaitons
