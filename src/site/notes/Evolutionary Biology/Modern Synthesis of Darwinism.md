Synthesis of Darwin's evolution by natural selection theory with Mendel's theory of genetics.
## Tenets of the modern synthesis
*(as given in [[Evolutionary Biology/Evolution - Intro\|Evolution - Intro]] intro lecture)*
- Genetic Variation is the raw material for evolution
- Micro-evolutionary processes explain macro-evolutionary patterns
- Allele frequency changes are caused by more than just natural selection
## Explanation from Behavioural Ecology textbook
- All organisms have genes which code for proteins, these proteins influence the phenotype and behaviour of the organism
- Within a population many genes are present in multiple alleles, which code for variarions on the same protein. These cause differences in development and function (see [[Ecology/Four-Question Framework\|Four-Question Framework]])
- Alleles that result in more copies of itself will eventually replace the alternative within the population - natural selection is the differential survival of alternative alleles through their impacts on replication success.
