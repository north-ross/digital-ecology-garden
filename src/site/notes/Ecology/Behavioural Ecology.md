Essential Reading: Intro to Behavioural Ecology 4th Ed, Chapters 1&2, Recommended Ch 7&8

## The study of how behavior evolves in relation to ecological, physical and social conditions
- More recently, these principles have been applied to more than just birds, insects and mammals - plants and microbes for example

## Why does an organism do what it does? What function does it serve?
- Eat, reproduce and die

# Reproductive decisions
- Examples: Burying beetle - easy to experiment on since they can live entirely in a terrarium and test hypotheses across all organisms
- Investment in young - Kiwi only lays one, very large egg with long gestational period
- Survival decisions - signal coloration, butterfly larva to mimic a snake, octopus carrying shells

- Conflict over reproduction shapes behaviour

# Conservation and Behaviour
- Using an understanding of animal behaviour to implement conservation decisions
## Example: Barnacle geese
- Ideas on using behaviour to avoid conflict:
	- Provide alternative landing areas
	- simulate predators (scarecrow)
	-
