Gene flow
Genetic Drift
Mutation

Related to [[Evolutionary Biology/Evolution - Intro\|Evolution - Intro]]

## Correlation between a trait in parent and offspring - is there a nongenetic reason for this correlation?
- [[Ecology/Maternal effect\|Maternal effect]] - if a mother has less resources, their offspring may not preform as well
- Therefore this is not a heritable trait but an environmental factor
- Ideally you could rear them for a few generations in the lab to remove this effect

## Gene flow is driven by dispersal
- emigration and immigration

### Genetic Rescue of inbred wolf population
- Remnant wolf population of central Sweden that was geographically isolated from other wolves
- Founded by two individuals in the 1980s
- Outbred individuals preformed much better
- Is there a mechanism for inbreeding avoidance? Unsure
## Genetic drift
- Change in allele frequency from chance events
- More of an effect on small populations, where genetic drift generally causes a reduction in overall variation since certain alleles will go extinct
# Three Core [[Modes of Selection\|Modes of Selection]]
## Stabilizing
Reduction of variation, moving towards the mean
## Directional
Moving towards one side of the distribution

- Example given of the Medium Ground Fish on Isla Daphne Major (Galapagos), where after a 1970s dought the larger beak sizes were selected for
## Disruptive
Moving away from the mean in both directions

## Example - Antibiotic Resistance
- Bacteria have a fast evolution rate and antibiotic resistance is heritable
# [[Ecology/Life History Adaptations\|Life History]] [[Evolutionary Biology/Trade-off\|Trade-off]]s

- Examples are:
	- Number vs quality of offspring
	- Development time cs body size
# Detecting [[Evolutionary Biology/Natural Selection\|Adaptation]]
## Local adaptation studies
### Example given with Trinidad pond guppies
- Able to study selective factors in a small localized natural area

## Altitudinal/Latitudinal clines
- studying variation across latitude or altitude
- Can measure correlation with these values
- *Drosophila melanogaster* variation in wing size across latitudinal cline in Australia and USA. 
- Latitude of course effects temperature, day length, UV intensity, seasonality
- since *Drosophila* reproduce quickly and are easy to keep large populations it is feasible to study evolution in the lab. You can take populations from the wild and isolate certain variables to study the effect of certain species
## Phenotypic Variation
In this example, the three colored lines represent three different genotypes. In the first example, the phenotype is affected by the environment irrespective of the genotype
- So, for example, in the first one, the phenotype responds to the environment irrespective of genetics. Environment 1 is colder and environment 2 is warmer. So in this case, the phenotype changes in response to this regardless of their genetics.
- The second one, there is no change due to environment, only related to genes
- In the third one, there is an effect of both - genetic effect and environment effect but their responses are different. Meaning certain phenotypes are more effective in certain environments

## Common Garden experiment
### Three spined stickleback
- Convergent evolution in freshwater vs marine forms in Japanese and Canadian individuals
- Testing in a common garden environment shows that freshwater individuals with fewer plates have more flexibility allowing for greater escape in more confined conditions
## Reciprocal Transplant
- Transplanting a plant from its northern edge to its southern edge of the natural range
	- *Arabidopsis thaliana*
- Estimate the fitness based on number of seeds per seed/seedling planted
- Fitness of local population is significantly higher than non-local population
# Rescue of natural populations from extinction following environmental change
- Genetic Rescue and Demographic Rescue
- Heterozygosity (a measure of  genetic diversity) accounted for greater survival rate. Patches with low diversity were more likely to go extinct if they didn't have enough mobility to mix with other populations
## Evolutionary [[genetic rescue\|genetic rescue]]
- Demographic time series (abundance of population over time) showing an environmental stress and associated decline
- Stochastic threshold - threshold of being able to maintain intself
- Genetic rescue event where new genes are added - in theory this results in saving the population from going extinct
