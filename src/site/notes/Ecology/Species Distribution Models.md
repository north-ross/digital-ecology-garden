- We need species occurence and environmental data
- Machine Learning is sometimes used
# Occurence data
- GBIF - presence only
- Forest Understory (LUKE) for Finland gives presence-absence for plants
# Environmental Data
- Chelsa WorldClim
- CORINE - Europe land cover
- SRTM - topography
# Creates a [[Ecology/Niche\|Niche]]
Hutchinson's n-dimensional hypervolume

# Evaluate model
- Split the data into training and test data - train with the test data
