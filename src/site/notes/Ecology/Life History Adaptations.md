Adaptations strongly linked to an individuals
- Growth
- Development
- Survivorship
- Reproductive parameters
These determine $r$, the population intrinsic growth rate.
# Energy consumption and body size in offspring
- Kleiber's Law states the resting metabolic rate is proportional to 3/4 of an animal's mass
	- A cat with mass 100x of a mouse will consume 32x the energy a mouse uses
# Life history [[Evolutionary Biology/Trade-off\|Trade-off]]s
- quality vs quantity, growth vs reproduction
# Number of reproductive events
## Iteroparity 
- many reproductive events - less resources for each event
- e.g. most mammals
## Semelparity
- Semelparous organisms only reproduce once and put all their effort into it
	- Octopus, Pacific salmon
# *K* and *r* strategies
AKA r-selected and K-selected
- (K is carrying capacity)
- r-strategy is density independent, population persists below K
- K-strategy density dependent, population persists near carrying capacity K
Not all species fit nicely in one category - cane toads can show either strategy as their range expands - individuals further from their introduction point are more r-selected and grow slower than individuals closer

# [[Ecology/Phenotypic Plasticity\|Phenotypic Plasticity]]
- Ability to change phenotype in response to different environments, or adaptability
- Example of great tits who lay eggs earlier as springs become warmer
