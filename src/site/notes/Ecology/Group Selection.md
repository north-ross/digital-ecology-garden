- Behaviour for the good of the group has been shown to not be an effective way to describe evolution of behaviour
- For example, the concept of evolving a natural birth control to stop over exploitation of food - this does not appear in nature
- In practice, groups usually do not go extinct fast enough for group selection to be an important force in evolution
- Individual selection is a much more powerful force, since individuals die and are replaced at a faster rate than groups
- Group selection also requires isolated populations where individuals cannot migrate between them to stop selfish individuals from overexploiting the food and spreading their genotype
- Group selection is overall a weak force compared to individual selection
# Example: Great Tit nests
(also described in [[Ecology/Fitness Proxy\|Fitness Proxy]])
- Experimental studies show that the optimal clutch size for maximum survival is around 10
	- This would be best for a selfish-gened bird
- but in nature the most common clutch size is 8. WHy?
## Hypotheses
### Hypothesis A: Lifetime reproductive output
- Perhaps over an individuals entire lifetime, it's better to have slightly smaller clutches which maximize success over an entire life, rather than per breeding attempt. 
- Putting more resources into one clutch might reduce the chance of survival to create more clutches in the future
### Hypothesis B: Cost of egg production and incubation
- This study placed extra eggs in the nest, but did not account for the work that females do to produce and incubate the eggs.
- If we could somehow force the females experimentally to increase their clutch size we could test this
## Summary
Both the original observation and the two hypotheses are measuring [[Evolutionary Biology/Trade-off\|Trade-off]]s:
- Original experiment measured trade-off between offspring number and and quality
- Hypothesis A would examine the trade-off between adult reproductive effort and adult mortality
- Hypothesis B would examine investment in egg production and incubation vs investment in chick care
## Dutch Study 2001
This [[Ecology/Experimental Studies in Behvaioural Ecology\|experimental study]] looked at great tit optimal clutch size in three experimental groups of females in different nest boxes:
	a. *Free chicks*: The females get two extra nestlings added after their brood hatched
	b. *Free eggs*: Two extra eggs are added on the day the female begins incubation
	c. *Full costs*: The female is induced to la two extra eggs by removing the first four eggs on the day they are laid, these are kept nearby and returned when incubation begins.
### Results
No difference in amount of young surviving to breeding age was found between the treatments, so no support for Hypothesis B. 

However, greater investment in egg survival did have a cost on female survival, which supports Hypothesis A (at least for two eggs).
