# What is Community Ecology?
- Patterns in diversity, abundance and composition of species in communities. By identifying patterns, we can predict dynamics in communities
# What is a community?
- No hard and fast definition
- A **group of species** that occur together in space and time that influence each other
	- [[Ecology/Spatial Ecology\|Spatial]] scale is very important to this
- All limits on space andtime are arbitrary and dynamic
	- Many "communities" studied are really point estimates of overlapping distributions
- Can be ecosystem or biome specific - need to define your community at the start of your paper
## [[Ecology/Species Interactions\|Species Interactions]]
- Very complicated, can be generalized:
### Trophic interactions
- A way to generalize species interactions within a community by grouping them based on their trophic level
### Other interaction generalizations
- [[Ecology/Exploitation\|Exploitation]] (Predation and herbivory)
- Seed dispersal/pollination
- [[Ecology/Competition\|Competition]] (inter and intra-specific)
- [[Ecology/Facilitation\|Facilitation]]

# How do we measure communities?
## Depends on the scale
- Alpha, Beta, Gamma diversity: as scale increases
### [[Ecology/Alpha Diversity\|Alpha Diversity]]
- Within one community
### [[Ecology/Beta Diversity\|Beta Diversity]]
- Between two communities
### Gamma Diversity: 
- Is the overall number of species in the landscape
- Can be measured at any scale
- Alpha + beta = gamma diversity
## Earthworm example
Highlights differences between alpha, beta and gamma diversity
# Community assembly
- The processes that shape the community and diversity
- Selection
- Drift
- Dispersal
- Speciation
## The Species Pool
- The species available to a local community
- Shaped by evolutionary (speciation) and biogeographic processes
### Species Filters
From the global species pool:
- First there is a filter of dispersion
	- giving the regional species pool
- next the environmental filter (climate etc)
	- Giving the local species pool
- Next we have the biotic filter: Governing local [[Ecology/Species Interactions\|Species Interactions]]
	- Giving the community species pool
Speciation mostly occurs in the regional and global pools.
### Meta-community
A set of communities linked by dispersal of multiple species
## Species-area assembly or [[Island Biogeography\|Island Biogeography]]
- Bigger islands have more species, 
	- More space allows more species to exist together by reducing competition
- and islands closer to the mainland have more species
	- Higher rate of colonization and more mainland species have the dispersal capability needed to arrive
## [[Ecology/Niche\|Niche]]

# Hellinger Transformation
Is often used when transforming species count data into a continuous variable with a normal distribution, allowing for [[Ecological Modeling\|Ecological Modeling]] 
- Divide by row sum and take the square root
