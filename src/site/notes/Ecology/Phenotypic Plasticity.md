- From Behavioural Ecology assigned reading (Chapter 1)
- This is the degree of change that can occur in a phenoype as a response to changing environmental conditions
- *reaction norm* = relationship between phenotype and environment
## Example - bird breeding behaviour response to climate change
- Great tits in Wyndham Woods have adapted to begin laying eggs earlier (mean egg laying date advanced by 14 days). This seems to correlate with spring temperatures and caterpillar emergence
	- Micro-evolutionary change? Or just phenotypic plasticity?
