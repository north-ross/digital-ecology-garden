# Examples
- Space has long been recognized as an important factor for ecological processes
- [[Island Biogeography\|Island Biogeography]]
- [[Metapopulations\|Metapopulations]]
- Metacommunities
- Landscape genetics
# Definition
- Processes that affect species distribution and dynamics, and how these play out across space
# Scale
(Temporal or spatial)
## Resolution and Extent:
- usually, large extent requires medium/low resolution
- small extent requires high resolution
## Example:
- In hardwood forests of NE USA:
	- Least Flycatchers *negatively* influence the distribution of American Redstarts at 4-ha plot scale 
		- This is due to [[Ecology/Competition\|Competition]]
	- Over a regional (landscape) scale, they are *positively* associated
		- Since they are using the same habitat
## Types of Data
- Vector and Raster data
# [[Ecology/Landscape Ecology\|Landscape Ecology]] / land cover
# [[Ecology/Spatial Dependence\|Spatial Dependence]] (autocorrelation)

# [[Ecology/Species Distribution Models\|Species Distribution Models]]
