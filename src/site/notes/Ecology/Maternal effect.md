## Correlation between a trait in parent and offspring - is there a nongenetic reason for this correlation?
- Maternal effect- if a mother has less resources, their offspring may not preform as well
- Therefore this is not a heritable trait but an environmental factor
- Ideally you could rear them for a few generations in the lab to remove this effect
