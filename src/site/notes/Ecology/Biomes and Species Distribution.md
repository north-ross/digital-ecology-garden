- Other than the four bioclimatic zones in Finland, aquatic ecosystems are important such as lakes
- The Baltic Sea is unique as a shallow landlocked brackish sea. It has strong gradients in ecosystems and is being affected greatly by climate change
## Soil microbes
- Soil microbes are critical in terrestrial biomes, but are understudied
- How do soil microbes vary in diversity and function? Using [[Ecology/Functional Trait\|Functional Trait]] groups based on their ecological role
- Cold desert soils had the lowest level of functional phylogeneticand taxonomic diversity.
- By looking at functional gene groups, they can categorize the relative abundanceof soil microbes in different biomes and examine how they are different relative to each other.
## Changing biomes
- Geological history and ecological succession are natural causes
- Anthropogenic causes like climate change
	- Tundra is being affected especially: Shrinking home range, phenology mismatch, treelines movingtohigher elevation and latitude
	- Field based observations and remote sensing on plant community changes in the tundra is some interesting work
- Invasive species, land modification, urbanization
## Temperature Changes
- [[Ecology/Species Distribution Models\|Species Distribution Models]]
- Thermal curves can measure a species tolerance for certain temperatures - an ecotherm
- The breadth of thermal tolerance can determine if species is generalist or specialist
- Species thermal index 
	- mean annual temperature within the range of aspecies
- Community thermal index
	- weighted mean of STIsin a species assemblage
- Thermal preformance curves can be usedto predict how distributions will change with climate change
	- Projected distributions of species based on IPCC climate predictions.Will it hold the same thermal predictions?
- Temperature - relatively simple to study, but other factors like pH, pressure, light and food, so these predictions are not likely to be very specific.
- Graph compares which variables effect which species
## Changing thermal and hydrological environment influencing species distribution
- 2003 meta analysis of changes in phenology andranges in 1700 species by Parmesan & Yohe in Nature
- Species are moving towards poles, higher in elevation
- 279 showed a shift in phenology or ranges based on climate change
- Phenology changes 2.3 days per decadeand range limit at 6.1km per decade
- Thermophilisation of Finnish mothcommunities - cold adapted spcies have low persistence and lowcolonization rates of warm species
- Warm adapted species are not moving into Finland much as climate warms
## Biotic vs Abiotic factors
- In warmer climates, typically biotic factors ([[Ecology/Competition\|Competition]]) are more important than abiotic factors (temperature, light, enegery availability) in range limits. This hypothesis was tested in three different ways

Future questions - how can we validate these prediction models? will it be able to effect this?
