- Individuals behaving optimally will have more offspring.
- How do we measure this?
	- Number of offspring
	- Number of offpsring surviving to next generation
	- Lifetime Reproductive Success (LRS)
- These are all **proxies** and can be used to test a hypothesis, but not exacy
# Example: Wytham Woods, Oxford Great Tit study
- Long term field study of great tits established in 1947
- Longest continuous study of individually-marked birds
## Optimal clutch size: Important graph in the textbook (study this for exam!)
- Why is the optimum clutch size 10 according to a curve of maximum survival, but it's most common for there to be 8 eggs per clutch?
- Alternative hypothesis:
	- Does raising more young reduce parent's LRS?
	- Are there additional costs to rearing current young?
- Are there other trade-offs we need to measure to determine what causes the behaviour?
- Another later study showed that raising more young did reduce the parent's LRS.
