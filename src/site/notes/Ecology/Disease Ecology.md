# Reservoir - hosts and reservoir hosts
- Reservoir is where a disease remains in constant concentration. Usually an organism. The reservoir can be soil, or in a lake or stream for a bacteria or parasite. Viruses usually cannot live outside a host
- Host species takes the pathogen
- Some can be both
	- Beavers and a certain bacteria - can be infected and die, but also can have the disease endemic to them
- Example:
	- Bats can be reservoirs for SARS-CoV2, but are not the host (can be infected but don't develop the disease)
# Vectors
- Carry an infectious agent through purely mechanical means
- Can support growth or changes in the agent
	- Classic example is mosquito or tick
	- However something like a mouse can also be a vector if the disease attaches to its fur for example
- Difference between a vector and a reservoir:
	- Pathogens don't usually replicate in a reservoir: 
		- e.g. Lyme disease causing bacteria in ticks do not replicate inside the tick, it's just carried within the tick between animals
- Is a deer also a vector when it carries the ticks? Good question (I think no)
# Virulence
The cost of infection on host fitness
- Host mortality rate is the classic example
- Decrease in a number of offspring
- Severity of the disease (Immune response)
- Parasite replication rate
# Disease Risk
Hazard x Exposure x Vulnerability = Risk
- These are all components of disease risk

# Transmission modes
## Close contact 
- (rodents example) - they come in contact for competition, mating, social behaviour
- Aerosols from bodily fluids
### Horizontally and vertically transmitted pathogens
- Vertical - via offspring
- Horizontal - peer-to-peer
## Indirect transmission
- Example: Pathogen shed into water and transported to households
- Eat contaminated food or pick berries that were contaminated by another animal
## Intermediate transmission
- Disease that includes a complex lifestyle:
	- Intermediate component or reservoir in another species
	- Tropical diseases or parasites which reproduce in snakes orslugs
## Vector-borne transmission
- Mosquito, tick, borne
# Infection Dynamics
## Typical Example
Newborn animals are protected from infection from antibodies that they inherit, such as hantavirus in mice. After being infected once, you can't receive this disease again.

Typical dynamic is Susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, and then susceptible again.
## Infect-shed-spill-spread cascade
- Diseases that can be spread from humans to animals and back again
- Mouse is infected with mouse disease, sheds the disease into the environment, it is spilled over to humans, then spread within humans
- Examples:
	- Hantavirus is not an example here since it cannot be spread *among* humans (only to humans from mice)
	- COVID-19 is a whole cascade, since it can be spread among humans
- Shedding the virus involves contact among reservoir and humans
## Human-rodent contact
- Rodents entering human spaces, or humans entering wild spaces (outdoor recreation, work, agriculture)
# Pathogen transmission / Virulence [[Evolutionary Biology/Trade-off\|Trade-off]]
As virulence increases, transmission increases to a maximum then decreases.
- If virulence is too high, the negative effects on the host reduce the capacity for transmission
# Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model
only for a **completely susceptible** population

$$
R_0 \propto (\frac{infection}{contact}) \times (\frac{contact}{time}) \times (\frac{time}{infection})
$$
$$
R_0 \propto \tau \times \bar{c} \times d
$$
## Examples: Ebola and SARS
- Ebola (in this example) starts by infecting two from patient zero, therefore $R_0 = 2$ . 
- SARS patient zero infects four ($R_0 = 4$)
# Biodiversity is good for our health
## Dilution effect
- Pathogen diversity increases with biodiversity - this is good since they compete with each other and reduce the overall infection rate
- This concept was first examined in plant diseases but recently has been applied to animal diseases as well (reverse of behavioural ecology)
### Example - rewilding and restoration reducing disease risk
- Adding a new species (Increasing species richness) can result in encounter reduction within the population if the new species is [[Ecology/Competition\|competitive]] with the original species
- Susceptible host regulation - Introducing a non-host species to the disease gives the disease less opportunities
- Infected host mortality - a predator is more likely to [[Ecology/Exploitation\|predate]] on infected individuals if they are weaker, decreasing overall disease risk
## "old friends hypothesis" 
Our gut microbiome and other microorganisms result in greater overall health

# Rodents
- Rodents are very species-rich - we have a lot of reservoirs, but many more non-reservoir species (and many are reservoirs of zoonotic diseases in humans, but also other epizootic diseases within the rodents)
- Voles, mice and squirrels are the most important reservoir species
- Specialist species are less likely to be reservoirs, generalists more likely
## Why are rodents often reservoirs?
- High reproduction rate 
	- can happen all year round in some species like brown rats
	- some species like lemmings reproduce in the winter under the snow and reach sexual maturity in up to 14 days, but only live one year.
- Sexual maturity age
- High litter size
- Very social
## Why do rodents move indoors?
- Mus i hus - citizen science app where people report mice inside - data can be used to determine correlation between indoor mouse reports and disease incidences based on time of year
- ROdents which overwinter indoors are more likely to survive the winter
## Drivers of rodent population cycles:
- Food availability
- Predators
- Disease
### Wood lemmings
- have a cryptic population cycle - their genes result in lots of females sometimes
- They only eat moss
- They sometimes die suddenly and surprisingly
- Why?
	- Not predators.
	- Is it food or disease? Currently being studied.
# Tick-borne illnesses
Sheep are important in spreading tick-borne encepholitus (TBE)
## Lyme Disease
- Tick larvae (six legs) - predate on rodents, this is where infection occurs
- Nymphs predate onsmall animals and humans and can spread infection
- Adults predate on large ungulates, however usually after predation they are "cleared" of infection. Nevertheless, this also allows them to produce eggs and start the cycle again.
Wild boars spread zoonotic diseases like swine fever, however they have no role in spreading tick-borne pathogens

## Tularemia
- Reservoir in wetlands, can spread from mice to beavers and hares through ticks and mosquitoes (and people) - it is often fatal in larger animals
- Recently it has increased in Scandanavia - this could be due to increased precipitation,increasing wetness, wetlands are reservoirs for the disease, also more mosquitoes
- Beaver increase in Sweden also contributes to more wetness, and also beavers themselves as hosts
- Bank vole [[Ecology/Population Ecology\|population cycle]] correlates with Tularemia increases
- Tengmalm's Owl is a vole specialist and important predator 
- There is likely a relationship between Tengmalm's owl populations and Tularemia, especially since the owls selectively prey on infected bank voles
# *Othohantavirus puumalaense* (PUUV)
- Only infects bank vole, which typically outcompetes grey-sided vole, but this virus has resulted in the otherspecies increasing
- Common shrews which prey on bank voles will take out infected individuals (susceptible host mortality)
- Higher community complexity (biodiversity) means lower ==hazard== from virus
- Similar to in Tularemia, the Tengmalm's owl selectively preys on infected bank voles
- Bank voles infected with the virus move and urinate more, making them easier targets for the owls.
- Weather conditions also play an important role, therefore climate change has contributed to increased transmission risk
	- Wetter autumns (i.e. warmer) leads to :
		- Increased environmental persistence 
		- decreases the health of rodents
		- Reduces the space available for voles and therefore increases transmission
- Overall a very complicated ecology of this disease
