- Characterizes the relationship between human actions and biological responses
- Plans to remediate the effects of human action
# Impact Ecology
- Rachel Carson and impacts of pesticides
- 1970s
# Restoration
- 1980s
# [[Ecological Resilience\|Ecological Resilience]]
- 2000s
- Manage processes that allow recovery and adaptation to change
- Difficult to use in practice
# Solutions vs non-solutions
- Ecological journal studies are mostly not solution oriented
- In the media they are almost always applied
# Ecological Paradigms
## Example: Maximum sustainable yield
- Focus on [[Ecology/Population Ecology\|populations]] - used to regulate game and fisheries
- Has been successful with game management, but not with fisheries
- fisheries have collapsed around the world despite these MSY principles being used for management
- This could be related to:
	- oversimplified models
	- lack of data on on fish (data deficiences)
	- fishing season is longer than hunting season
	- Political issues - lobbying
## [[Island Biogeography\|Island Biogeography]]
- Very influential inreserve design and estimating species loss
- However, reults in nature reserves being isolated from their surroundings
## [[Metapopulations\|Metapopulations]]
Very important in fragmented landscapes
- Favoring connectivity between patches
- Not all species function as metapopulations
