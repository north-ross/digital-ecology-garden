# History
1917 Grinnell - "habitat or environment a species can occupy"
1927 Elton - "Function fulfilled by a species within its ecological community"
1957 (**Hutchinson**'s definition) - "**n-dimensional hypervolume**" defining the requirements of a population to persist"
- Usually represented in 2 dimensions
# Fundamental Niche:
- Part of environment that a species *could* occupy in the *absense* of [[Ecology/Species Interactions\|interactions]] with other species 
# Realized Niche:
- Result of pressureand interactions with other species such as competition or exploitation
# Neutral Theory
- The null hypothesis to niche theory
	- Stresses inter-specific interactions
- If all species within a trophic level all had the same probability per capita of reproducing, dying, dispersing and speciating, we can model a "null hypothesis" and compare with observed values to see if there is a pattern
- Each individual has a $1/(J-1)$ probability of colonizing the unfilled site where $J$ is the total number of sites
- Each species has a $N_i / (J-1)$ probability of colonizing the unfilled site where $N_i$ is the number of species $i$.
